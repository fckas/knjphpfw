#About this fork:

The focus of this fork is to make the code easier to maintain, document it and make it work properly with UTF-8 encoding.
* This will mainly be done by making the code style comply with PEAR.
* The framework will expect UTF-8 as the internal encoding.
* Deprecated and non-OOP code will be removed and replaced with OOP code.
* Parts NOT used by fcomputer.dk are likely to be dropped.


#HOW TO INSTALL

* Make sure you have PHP5 installed (on Ubuntu install the "php5" package).
* Create a symlink named "knj" in "/usr/share/php" pointing to the folder containing the framework.
