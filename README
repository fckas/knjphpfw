#About this fork:

The focus of this fork is to make the code easier to maintain, document it and make it work properly with UTF-8 encoding.
This will mainly be done by making the code style comply with PEAR. The framework will expect UTF-8 as the internal encoding. Depricated code and non OOP code will be removed and be replaced with OOP code. Functions not used by fcomputer.dk are likely to be droped.

#HOW TO INSTALL

* Make sure you have the PHP5 installed (on Ubuntu install the "php5"-package).
* Create a symlinks called knj in "/usr/share/php" pointing to the folder contaning the framework
