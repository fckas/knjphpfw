#About this branch:
UPDATE: As of commit c56fa1c11b1beee1ac1c75ee4d0d1844a1d97fea, compatibility and feature set is no longer maintained.

The focus of this branch is to make the code easier to maintain, document it and make it work properly with UTF-8 encoding.
This will mainly be done by making the code style comply with PEAR style. The framework will expect UTF-8 as the internal encoding. Depricated code and non OOP code will be removed and be replaced with OOP code.

#HOW TO INSTALL

* Make sure you have the PHP5 installed (on Ubuntu install the "php5"-package).
* Create a symlinks in "/usr/share/php"
